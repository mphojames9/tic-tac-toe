# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Build with HTML, CSS and Javascript

## What i have learned
Tic Tac Toe is a simple ruleset that flexes the basic concepts in programming,
like data structures for storing the board, conditional logic for knowing whose
turn it is or if someone has won.

Because of the simple game rules, Tic Tac Toe is very easy to decompose into discrete, small, functionality,
that we can then put together to create a complete game. This process of decomposition and synthesis,
breaking something down and putting it back together, is absolutely essential to programming.

This was a great achievement for my skill developement.
