# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Build with HTML, CSS and Javascript

## What i have learned
* Tic Tac Toe is a simple ruleset that flexes the basic concepts in programming,
like data structures for storing the board, conditional logic for knowing whose
turn it is or if someone has won.

*  Because of the simple game rules, Tic Tac Toe is very easy to decompose into discrete, small, functionality,
that we can then put together to create a complete game. This process of decomposition and synthesis,
breaking something down and putting it back together, is absolutely essential to programming.

* This was a great achievement for my skill developementas a bigginer
